.. py:module:: fuzzy_dl_owl2.fuzzydl.concept.concrete.left_concrete_concept



.. ── LLM-GENERATED DESCRIPTION START ──

Implements a left shoulder fuzzy set concept where membership degrees are maximized at lower values and decrease linearly towards zero.


Description
-----------


The logic models a specific type of fuzzy membership function characterized by full satisfaction for inputs below a certain threshold and a linear decline to zero satisfaction as inputs approach an upper limit. It requires four numerical parameters to define the domain of validity and the specific transition interval, enforcing strict ordering constraints during initialization to guarantee mathematical consistency. Membership calculation returns a value of 1.0 for inputs at or below the lower transition point, 0.0 for inputs at or above the upper transition point, and a linearly interpolated result for values falling within the intermediate range. To facilitate complex reasoning, the implementation supports logical operations such as negation, conjunction, and disjunction through operator overloading, delegating the computational logic to a dedicated handler while providing capabilities for cloning and generating canonical string identifiers.

   This class models a left shoulder fuzzy set, representing a concept where membership is maximized at lower values and decreases linearly towards zero. It is defined by a domain of validity `[k1, k2]` and a satisfaction interval `[a, b]`, where membership is 1 for inputs less than or equal to `a`, 0 for inputs greater than or equal to `b`, and linearly interpolated for values in between. To use this class, instantiate it with a name and the four float parameters, ensuring that `k1` is less than or equal to `a` and `k2` is greater than or equal to `b` to satisfy validation constraints. Once instantiated, the membership degree of a specific value can be retrieved, and the object supports logical operations like negation, conjunction, and disjunction through standard Python operators.

   :param k1: The lower bound of the domain interval [k1, k2] over which the concept is defined.
   :type k1: float
   :param k2: The upper bound of the interval [k1, k2] defining the domain of the concept.
   :type k2: float
   :param _a: The lower bound of the transition interval, defining the point at which the membership degree begins to decrease from 1.0.
   :type _a: float
   :param _b: The upper bound of the satisfaction interval, representing the point at which the membership degree becomes zero.
   :type _b: float


   .. py:method:: __and__(value: Self) -> Self

      Implements the bitwise AND operation (`&`) for the concept, calculating the intersection between the current instance and another instance of the same type. This method delegates the actual computation to `OperatorConcept.and_` and returns a new instance representing the result, ensuring that the original operands remain unmodified. It enables the combination of concepts to identify shared properties or elements.

      :param value: The other operand to perform the AND operation with.
      :type value: typing.Self

      :return: The result of the bitwise AND operation between the instance and the provided value.

      :rtype: typing.Self



   .. py:method:: __hash__() -> int

      Calculates a hash value for the instance to support its use in hash-based collections like dictionaries and sets. The hash is derived from the string representation of the object, ensuring that the hash value is consistent with the textual output generated by the `__str__` method. Consequently, any changes to the string representation logic will directly affect the hash value, potentially impacting lookups in previously populated hash tables.

      :return: An integer hash value computed from the object's string representation.

      :rtype: int



   .. py:method:: __neg__() -> fuzzy_dl_owl2.fuzzydl.concept.concrete.fuzzy_concrete_concept.FuzzyConcreteConcept

      Implements the unary negation operator, allowing the concept to be inverted using the minus sign. This method computes the logical negation of the current instance by delegating to the `OperatorConcept.not_` static method. The operation returns a new `FuzzyConcreteConcept` representing the complement of the original concept, leaving the source instance unmodified.

      :return: A new concept representing the logical negation of the current concept.

      :rtype: FuzzyConcreteConcept



   .. py:method:: __or__(value: Self) -> Self

      Implements the bitwise OR operation for the concept, enabling the use of the pipe operator (`|`) to combine the current instance with another value of the same type. This method delegates the underlying logic to the `OperatorConcept.or_` static method, which calculates the result. The operation returns a new instance of `LeftConcreteConcept` representing the union or disjunction of the operands, ensuring that the original objects remain unmodified.

      :param value: The right-hand operand to combine with the current instance using the OR operation.
      :type value: typing.Self

      :return: The result of the OR operation between the current instance and the provided value.

      :rtype: typing.Self



   .. py:method:: clone() -> Self

      Creates and returns a new instance that is a copy of the current object. The clone is instantiated with the same values for `name`, `k1`, `k2`, `a`, and `b` as the original. This method does not modify the existing instance, though the resulting clone may share references to mutable objects if the constructor does not perform deep copying.

      :return: A new instance of the class with the same attributes as the current object.

      :rtype: typing.Self



   .. py:method:: compute_name() -> str

      Generates a canonical string representation of the concept by formatting the instance's defining parameters into a specific pattern. The returned string follows the format "left-shoulder(k1, k2, a, b)", utilizing the values of the attributes `k1`, `k2`, `a`, and `b`. This method is read-only and does not modify the state of the object.

      :return: A string representation of the left-shoulder function name, including its parameters.

      :rtype: str



   .. py:method:: get_membership_degree(value: float) -> float

      Computes the degree of membership for a given numerical value within a left-shoulder fuzzy set defined by the parameters `a` and `b`. The function returns 1.0 for values less than or equal to `a`, indicating full membership, and returns 0.0 for values greater than or equal to `b`, indicating no membership. For values falling strictly between `a` and `b`, the method performs a linear interpolation to determine a partial membership value between 0.0 and 1.0. This implementation assumes that `a` is strictly less than `b` to avoid division by zero errors during the interpolation step.

      :param value: The numeric input value for which to calculate the membership degree.
      :type value: float

      :return: The degree of membership of the input value, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Returns 1.0 for values at or below the lower bound, 0.0 for values at or above the upper bound, and a linearly interpolated value for those in between.

      :rtype: float



   .. py:attribute:: _a
      :type:  float


   .. py:attribute:: _b
      :type:  float


   .. py:property:: a
      :type: float


      Updates the internal state of the object by assigning a new value to the property 'a'. The method explicitly converts the provided input to a float before storing it in the private attribute `_a`, ensuring type consistency. This operation modifies the object in place and may raise an exception if the input cannot be converted to a float.

      :param value: The new value to assign, which will be converted to a float.
      :type value: float


   .. py:property:: b
      :type: float


      Sets the value of the 'b' attribute, ensuring it is stored as a floating-point number. The input value is explicitly cast to a float before being assigned to the internal private attribute '_b'. This operation modifies the object's state in place and will raise an error if the conversion is not possible.

      :param value: The new value to assign to the b attribute, converted to a float.
      :type value: float


   .. py:attribute:: k1
      :type:  float

      Sets the value of the `k1` attribute for the instance, converting the input to a float to ensure type consistency. This method updates the private `_k1` variable, effectively modifying the internal state of the `FuzzyConcreteConcept` object. Any subsequent operations relying on this parameter will reflect the new value.

      :param value: The new value for the k1 attribute.
      :type value: float


   .. py:attribute:: k2
      :type:  float

      Sets the upper bound parameter k2 for the fuzzy concrete concept. This method enforces a constraint ensuring that the new value is greater than or equal to the existing k1 parameter; if k1 is larger than the provided value, a ValueError is raised. Upon successful validation, the input is converted to a float and stored in the internal state.

      :param value: The value to assign to the k2 parameter, which must be greater than or equal to k1.
      :type value: float

      :raises ValueError: Raised if the provided value is less than `k1`, as `k2` must be greater than or equal to `k1`.
