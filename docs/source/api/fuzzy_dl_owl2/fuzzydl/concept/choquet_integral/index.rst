.. ── LLM-GENERATED DESCRIPTION START ──

A fuzzy description logic concept that aggregates a list of weighted sub-concepts using a Choquet integral mechanism.


Description
-----------


The software defines a specialized fuzzy description logic entity that combines multiple sub-concepts into a single composite structure based on a Choquet integral aggregation strategy. By inheriting from both the base ``Concept`` class and an interface for weighted concepts, it ensures that numerical weights are strictly paired with corresponding conceptual definitions, enforcing a constraint that the number of weights must match the number of sub-concepts during initialization. Logical operations such as negation, conjunction, and disjunction are supported by delegating the processing to a separate operator utility, allowing these complex concepts to participate in broader logical expressions and hierarchies. Furthermore, the functionality includes structural manipulation capabilities such as cloning the object to preserve state, recursively replacing specific internal components, and traversing the hierarchy to extract atomic concepts and roles for analysis or reasoning.

   This class models a complex concept defined by the aggregation of sub-concepts using a Choquet integral mechanism. It serves as a container that pairs a list of floating-point weights with a corresponding list of `Concept` objects, requiring that both lists be of equal length during instantiation. Users can interact with this object to perform logical operations such as conjunction, disjunction, and negation, or to traverse the concept hierarchy to retrieve atomic concepts and roles. Additionally, the class provides functionality to clone the structure or replace specific internal concepts within the aggregation.

   :param name: The string representation of the concept, formatted as a Choquet integral containing its weights and sub-concepts.
   :type name: str
   :param weights: A list of numerical values representing the importance or contribution of each associated concept in the integral.
   :type weights: typing.Any


   .. py:method:: __and__(value: Self) -> Self

      Computes the logical conjunction of the current instance with another `ChoquetIntegral` by utilizing the bitwise AND operator (`&`). This method delegates the specific combination logic to the `OperatorConcept.and_` static method, abstracting the implementation details of the operation. The result is a new `ChoquetIntegral` object representing the intersection or logical combination of the two inputs, without modifying the original instances.

      :param value: The other operand to perform the AND operation with.
      :type value: typing.Self

      :return: The result of the logical AND operation between this instance and the provided value.

      :rtype: typing.Self



   .. py:method:: __hash__() -> int

      Computes the hash value for the instance, allowing it to be used as a key in dictionaries or as an element in sets. The hash is generated by converting the object to its string representation and hashing the resulting string. Consequently, the hash value is dependent on the implementation of the `__str__` method, and any mutation of the object that alters its string representation will result in a different hash, potentially causing issues if the object is used as a dictionary key after modification.

      :return: An integer hash value derived from the string representation of the object.

      :rtype: int



   .. py:method:: __neg__() -> fuzzy_dl_owl2.fuzzydl.concept.concept.Concept

      Implements the unary negation operator for the Choquet integral, enabling the use of the minus sign (`-`) to represent logical negation. This method returns a new `Concept` object that encapsulates the complement of the current integral, effectively delegating the creation of this negated representation to `OperatorConcept.not_`. The operation does not modify the original instance in place but instead produces a distinct object representing the negated state.

      :return: The logical negation of the current concept.

      :rtype: Concept



   .. py:method:: __or__(value: Self) -> Self

      Implements the logical disjunction (OR) operation for the `ChoquetIntegral` class, enabling the use of the pipe operator (`|`) to combine instances. It accepts another instance of the same type and returns a new `ChoquetIntegral` representing the result of the disjunction, leaving the original operands unchanged. The specific logic for the operation is delegated to the `OperatorConcept.or_` method.

      :param value: Another instance of the same class to combine with the current instance using the OR operation.
      :type value: typing.Self

      :return: A new instance representing the logical OR of the current object and the provided value.

      :rtype: typing.Self



   .. py:method:: clone() -> Self

      Creates and returns a new instance of the ChoquetIntegral that is a copy of the current object. The method performs a shallow copy of the internal `weights` and `concepts` lists, ensuring that the new object contains independent list containers. This allows the clone to be modified without affecting the original object's list structures, although changes to mutable elements within those lists will be reflected in both instances.

      :return: A new instance of the class that is a copy of the current object, containing copies of the weights and concepts.

      :rtype: typing.Self



   .. py:method:: compute_atomic_concepts() -> set[fuzzy_dl_owl2.fuzzydl.concept.concept.Concept]

      Aggregates the atomic concepts derived from the constituent concepts within the Choquet Integral by iterating through the collection stored in the instance. For each concept, it delegates the computation to the concept's own `compute_atomic_concepts` method and collects the results into a unified set, ensuring that duplicate atomic concepts are removed. This method operates as a read-only aggregation, returning an empty set if the instance contains no constituent concepts.

      :return: A set of all atomic concepts derived from the object's concepts.

      :rtype: set[Concept]



   .. py:method:: compute_name() -> str

      Generates a formatted string representation of the Choquet integral instance, intended for identification or display purposes. The method constructs the output by joining the string values of the instance's concepts and, if present, its weights, separating them with spaces. If the weights attribute is None, the weights section of the resulting string is left empty. The final string follows the specific syntax "(choquet (weights) (concepts))", encapsulating the integral's configuration within a parenthetical structure.

      :return: A string representation of the Choquet model, formatted to include the weights and concepts.

      :rtype: str



   .. py:method:: get_roles() -> set[str]

      Retrieves the union of roles defined across all concepts associated with this ChoquetIntegral instance. It iterates over the internal collection of concepts, aggregating the results of their individual `get_roles` methods into a single set to ensure uniqueness. The method returns an empty set if no concepts are present or if none define roles, and it does not modify the state of the instance or its concepts.

      :return: A set of unique role names aggregated from all concepts.

      :rtype: set[str]



   .. py:method:: replace(a: fuzzy_dl_owl2.fuzzydl.concept.concept.Concept, c: fuzzy_dl_owl2.fuzzydl.concept.concept.Concept) -> fuzzy_dl_owl2.fuzzydl.concept.concept.Concept

      Recursively replaces all occurrences of the concept `a` with the concept `c` within the list of concepts held by this integral. A new Choquet integral is instantiated using the original weights and the modified list of concepts, ensuring that the original object remains unmodified. The method returns the arithmetic negation of this newly constructed integral.

      :param a: The concept to be replaced by `c`.
      :type a: Concept
      :param c: The concept to substitute for 'a' in the underlying concepts.
      :type c: Concept

      :return: A new Concept representing the negation of a Choquet Integral constructed by replacing every occurrence of concept `a` with concept `c` in the original integral's sub-concepts.

      :rtype: Concept
