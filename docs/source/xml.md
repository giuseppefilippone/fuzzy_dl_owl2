# Fuzzy OWL 2 XML Annotations

This document outlines the XML structures used to represent FuzzyDL concepts, datatypes, and roles within the FuzzyOWL2 framework, as defined in the source code. It includes the XML representation, descriptions, and keys for each element, as well as the XML structures generated by the `FuzzyXML` utility class.
