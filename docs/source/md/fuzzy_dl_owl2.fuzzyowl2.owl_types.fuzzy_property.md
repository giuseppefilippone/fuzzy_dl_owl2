# Summary

Establishes an abstract structural blueprint for properties governed by fuzzy logic principles within the FuzzyOWL2 ontology framework.

## Description

Serving as a foundational component within the FuzzyOWL2 ontology framework, the abstract base class provides a standardized interface for representing relationships that operate under fuzzy logic principles rather than binary constraints. By enforcing a specific structural blueprint, it ensures that all derived concrete property types consistently handle degrees of membership or truth, which is essential for modeling uncertainty in knowledge representation systems. Developers are expected to extend this blueprint to create specific implementations, thereby maintaining architectural consistency across the fuzzy knowledge representation system while allowing for diverse property behaviors.
