# Summary

An abstract base class defining the structure for queries that evaluate role assertions and relationships between individuals within a fuzzy description logic framework.

## Description

It serves as a foundational interface for evaluating the entailment of role assertions, specifically focusing on the relationships between individuals. Designed to support operations that determine minimum or maximum degrees of membership, it acts as a shared structure for more specific query implementations. The implementation encapsulates the necessary parameters for these evaluations, including the specific role being examined, the subject and object individuals involved in the relation, and an expression representing the desired degree of membership. By defining these attributes, it provides a standardized way to construct and process queries regarding the strength or validity of connections within a logical framework.
