# Summary

Core type definitions and data structures for modeling fuzzy logic concepts, properties, and mathematical functions within the FuzzyOWL2 ontology framework.

## Description

An object-oriented hierarchy of abstract base classes establishes a structural blueprint for representing fuzzy logic entities, ensuring that all derived implementations share a consistent interface for categorization and data access. Concrete components extend these foundations to model complex logical operations, including various aggregation methods like Sugeno and Choquet integrals, weighted sums, and ordered weighted averaging, which combine multiple sub-concepts based on specific importance weights. Mathematical membership functions, such as triangular, trapezoidal, and linear shapes, define the degrees of truth for fuzzy sets, while linguistic hedges and modifiers provide mechanisms to dynamically adjust these membership values or alter properties and datatypes. Encapsulating parameters like coefficients, bounds, and weights within these specialized objects facilitates the serialization, processing, and reasoning required for handling uncertainty and imprecision in knowledge representation.
