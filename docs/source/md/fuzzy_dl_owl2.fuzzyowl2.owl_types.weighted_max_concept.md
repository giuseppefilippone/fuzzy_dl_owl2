# Summary

Implements a fuzzy logic operator that performs weighted maximum aggregation over a collection of concepts.

## Description

The software defines a data structure for representing a weighted maximum aggregation operator used in fuzzy logic ontologies. By extending a base definition class, it integrates into the broader type system and identifies itself specifically as a weighted maximum entity. During initialization, it accepts a collection of other concept definitions which act as the operands for the fuzzy logic calculation. Access to these internal components is provided for further processing, while a string representation method allows the structure to be visualized in a human-readable format.
