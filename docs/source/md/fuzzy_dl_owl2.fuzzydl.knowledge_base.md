# Summary

This file implements the core engine for a fuzzy description logic reasoner that combines a tableau-based reasoning algorithm with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to determine the satisfiability and truth degrees of fuzzy assertions. The architecture separates the logical reasoning layer from the mathematical optimization layer, with the `KnowledgeBase` class acting as the central controller for the ontology state, while the `MILPHelper` manages the optimization model. The reasoning process is divided into distinct phases: TBox preprocessing (normalization and absorption), ABox expansion (applying inference rules), and optimization. It supports multiple fuzzy logic semantics, allowing users to choose between different interpretations of implication and conjunction. To ensure termination of the tableau expansion, the system employs blocking strategies that prevent infinite loops in the completion forest. The reasoning process is incremental, updating the MILP model with new constraints as it expands the knowledge base. Helper classes such as `DatatypeReasoner`, `LukasiewiczSolver`, `ZadehSolver`, and `ClassicalSolver` implement the specific fuzzy logic semantics for conjunction, disjunction, and quantifiers, while `IndividualHandler` and `CreatedIndividualHandler` manage the lifecycle of individuals, including their creation, blocking, and unblocking. Additionally, the file includes serialization methods to persist the knowledge base state and cloning capabilities to copy the state without the ABox.
