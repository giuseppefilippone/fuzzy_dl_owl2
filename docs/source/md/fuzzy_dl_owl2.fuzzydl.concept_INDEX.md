# Summary

A comprehensive framework for fuzzy description logic that models complex logical constructs, quantified role restrictions, and various fuzzy aggregation operators.

## Description

The architecture centers on an abstract base class that defines the interface for constructing and manipulating logical formulas, enabling the creation of complex expressions through operator overloading and factory patterns. It supports a wide array of fuzzy logic semantics, including classical, Gödel, and Łukasiewicz logics, while providing utilities for normalizing expressions into Conjunctive or Disjunctive Normal Forms. Beyond standard logical operations, the framework models quantified role restrictions, such as universal and existential constraints, as well as value restrictions and self-referential concepts to define intricate relationships between individuals. Advanced fuzzy reasoning capabilities are provided through a suite of aggregation operators, including Choquet and Sugeno integrals, Ordered Weighted Averaging, and various weighted combinations, alongside concrete domain concepts that handle numerical membership functions and fuzzy numbers. The design relies on abstract interfaces to enforce contracts for roles, values, and weighted components, ensuring structural integrity during recursive traversal, cloning, and sub-concept replacement.
